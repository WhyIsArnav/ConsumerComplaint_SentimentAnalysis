## Directory ðŸ“–
The columns that were used are: 
- Product
- Company
- Consumer Complaint Narrative

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
1. Filter
   - Filtering database for null values in the Consumer Complaint Narrative column
   ```
   df <- complaints %>%
   filter(Consumer.complaint.narrative !="")
   ```
   - Filter database according to companies and products
   ```
   chase <- df %>% #filter Chase
   filter(Company == "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")
   
   std_loan <- df %>% #Filter student loans only 
   filter(Product == "Student loan")
   ```
2. Pivot Tables
   - Use the Pivot table to tidy data and get it ready for analysis
   ```
   std_loan_pivot <- std_loan %>% #tidy data
   group_by(Consumer.complaint.narrative) %>%
   summarize()

   tidy_std_loan <- std_loan_pivot %>% #tidy data ready for analysis 
   ungroup() %>%
   unnest_tokens(word, Consumer.complaint.narrative)
   ```
   ```
   chase_cc_pivot <- chase_cc %>% #tidying data 
   group_by(Consumer.complaint.narrative) %>%
   summarize()

   tidy_chase_cc <- chase_cc_pivot %>% #tidy data for analysis 
   ungroup() %>%
   unnest_tokens(word, Consumer.complaint.narrative)
   ```

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, I found that negative emotion was most prevalent in student loan complaints, while consumers feeling surprised was the least. This could indicate there is a general feeling that dealing with student loans can be tedious work. 

Companies like Equifax, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase had the highest aggregate negative score. It is also true that these companies had the highest number of complaints too. Companies like Freedom Morgage and Great Lakes had the best aggregate sentiment scores. 

Lastly, we see that words such as "dispute", "debt", "fraud", "denial", "issue", "complaint", "error", and "problem" are most used when consumers complain about Chase Credit Card
